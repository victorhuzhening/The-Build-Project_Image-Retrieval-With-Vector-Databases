## Build Project: Image Retrieval With Vector Databases ##

An image retrieval system using FAISS fast vector indexing for fast look-up, a front-end built using Streamlit Python library, and a fine-tuned VGG-16 model as the backbone for learning image embeddings. This repo showcases my work with The Build Fellowship under the supervision of Kamalesh Kalirathinam.
